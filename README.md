### Completing assignments

Follow these steps for each assignment:

1. To start, [**fork** the repository][forking].
1. [**Clone**][ref-clone] the repository to your computer.
1. Modify the files and [**commit**][ref-commit] changes to complete your solution.
1. [**Push**][ref-push]/sync the changes up to GitHub.
1. [Create a **pull request**][pull-request] on the original repository to turn in the assignment.
2. To make sure you are up to date with changes run 'git remote add upstream git@github.com:WSO-CS/individual-student-work.git'
3. Then run 'git pull upstream master'

### Reviewing assignments

Once created, I will do a code review with line-by-line feedback directly within the pull request. If I ask you to submit corrections, you can push fixes up to their forks, which will be reflected in the pull request.
